# bookstore-database
A database management program written in Python and using the SQLite module.

This program connects to, or creates if it doesn't exist yet, a database file using he SQLite module.
A 'books' table is created and then populates it with 5 initial records of books.

The program then allows for the user to do the following:
  1. Enter data for a new book and add this record into the database
  2. Update an existing record in the database, to modify parts of or all of the information
  3. Delete a record from the database
  4. Search for entries in the database using the specific book code or via words as a search term, which displays books with relevant titles

This is a demonstration of how to work with SQL in a Python program for handling databases.
